# homedash.info

Note: If you were redirected here after trying to reach homedash.info, it happened for one of two reasons:
1) The Ubuntu Server running on my raspberry-pi is down.
2) I've closed off access since I'm tired of outsiders messing around with the devices in our apartments living room.

I usually only open up access to the app during the period of time when I'm applying to new internships, so I can show off the stuff that I've made.

If you'd like to see my home dashboard in action, please email me at: nick.shields@live.com


Thanks!
